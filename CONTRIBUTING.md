# How to contribute

Since the project is under heavy development, we are more than happy to onboard new contributors!

If you are interested to add new functionality or work on a specific feature that you think is missing, simply open an issue, fork the repo and issue a pull request.

Also you can reach out to us directly [Contact](https://github.com/IBM/dataset-lifecycle-framework#contact)
